# Review Loop

Taskplane uses an explicit reviewer loop to reduce single-agent blind spots.

## Why a review loop exists

Worker agents optimize for progress. Reviewers optimize for quality and correctness.

Using a separate reviewer model improves:

- defect detection
- standards compliance
- confidence before merge

---

## Review actors

- **Worker**: implements step checklist items
- **Reviewer**: inspects plan/code and writes structured verdict file

Reviewer output is file-based and must be written to disk for orchestration logic to consume it.

---

## Verdicts

Reviewer verdicts:

- `APPROVE`
- `REVISE`
- `RETHINK`
- `UNAVAILABLE`

Interpretation:

- `APPROVE`: continue to next step
- `REVISE`: worker addresses feedback inline (same context), then proceeds
- `RETHINK`: plan concerns — worker reconsiders approach
- `UNAVAILABLE`: reviewer failed to produce output — worker proceeds with caution

---

## Review levels (task metadata)

Task `Review Level` controls review rigor:

- `0`: no review loop
- `1`: plan review only
- `2`: plan + code review
- `3`: full rigor policy level (project may treat as highest scrutiny)

**Exception:** Step 0 (Preflight) and the final step (Documentation & Delivery)
always skip both plan and code reviews, regardless of review level. These
low-risk steps don't benefit from cross-model review.

---

## Worker-driven inline reviews (v0.9.0+)

Reviews are **worker-driven**: the worker agent invokes the `review_step` tool
at step boundaries, based on the task's review level. The reviewer spawns as
a subprocess with full telemetry, and the worker's context is preserved across
the tool call.

```text
Worker executing all steps in one context:

  For each substantive step (not Step 0 or final step):
    if review level ≥ 1:
      call review_step(step=N, type="plan")    → plan feedback
    implement the step
    commit changes
    if review level ≥ 2:
      call review_step(step=N, type="code", baseline=<pre-step SHA>)    → code feedback
      if REVISE: address feedback, commit fixes
    proceed to next step
```

Key behaviors:

- **Worker keeps context** — reviews happen mid-execution via a tool call.
  The worker doesn't lose its accumulated understanding of the codebase.
- **Reviewer spawns as subprocess** — a dedicated reviewer agent (e.g.,
  `orch-lane-1-reviewer`) with structured telemetry visible in the dashboard.
- **REVISE handled inline** — the worker reads the review file in `.reviews/`
  and addresses feedback immediately, in the same context that wrote the code.
- **Plan reviews** run before implementation to catch design issues early.
- **Code reviews** receive a baseline commit SHA so the reviewer sees only
  the step's changes (not the full cumulative diff).
- **Low-risk steps** (Step 0/Preflight and final step) skip all reviews
  automatically — both in the worker's review protocol and as a safety net
  in the tool handler.

### Dashboard visibility

During a review, the dashboard shows a **reviewer sub-row** below the active
task with live metrics: elapsed time, tool count, last tool, cost, and context%.
The worker row shows `[awaiting review]` until the reviewer finishes.

### Review availability

The `review_step` tool is registered during orchestrated execution (`/orch`).
Reviews are an integral part of the orchestrator’s worker/reviewer loop and
are configured via the project’s `taskplane-config.json`.

## Persistent reviewer context (v0.13.0+)

By default, the reviewer is a **persistent agent** that stays alive across all
`review_step` calls for a single task. This preserves the reviewer's accumulated
context — it remembers what it reviewed in earlier steps and can reference
previous findings (e.g., "I flagged X in Step 2's plan — checking if addressed").

### How it works

1. **First `review_step` call**: spawns a reviewer subprocess with the
   `reviewer-extension.ts` loaded. The extension registers a `wait_for_review`
   tool that blocks (via filesystem polling) until a review request arrives.
2. **Subsequent calls**: the task-runner writes a request file and a signal file
   to `.reviews/`. The persistent reviewer picks up the signal, reads the
   request, performs the review, and calls `wait_for_review` again.
3. **Task completion**: the task-runner writes a `.review-shutdown` signal. The
   reviewer exits cleanly on the next poll cycle. If it doesn't exit within
   the grace period (10s), the session is killed.

### Signal protocol

- **Request files**: `.reviews/request-R00N.md` — review request content
- **Signal files**: `.reviews/.review-signal-NNN` — contains the request filename
- **Shutdown**: `.reviews/.review-shutdown` — signals the reviewer to exit
- **Verdict files**: `.reviews/R00N-{type}-step{N}.md` — reviewer output (same as before)

### Fallback to fresh spawn

If the persistent reviewer session dies (context limit, crash, timeout), the
task-runner detects the dead session and falls back to spawning a fresh reviewer
for that specific review — the same single-shot behavior used before persistent
mode. This fallback is logged for visibility.

### Reliability defenses (v0.18.2+)

The persistent reviewer includes multiple reliability layers:

- **Explicit tool instructions**: The reviewer template and spawn prompt
  unambiguously instruct the model to call `wait_for_review` as a registered
  extension tool (not via `bash` or shell). Some models (e.g., OpenAI Codex
  variants) previously called it via bash, causing silent failures.
- **Early-exit detection**: If the reviewer exits within 30 seconds of spawn
  without producing a verdict, the task-runner treats this as a tool
  compatibility failure and immediately falls back to fresh-spawn mode instead
  of waiting for the 30-minute verdict timeout.
- **Verdict extraction tolerance**: The `extractVerdict` function tolerates
  non-standard verdict formats (e.g., "Changes requested" → REVISE, "Looks
  good" → APPROVE) so models that don't use the exact `### Verdict: X` format
  still produce usable verdicts.
- **Graceful double-failure skip**: If both persistent and fallback reviewers
  fail, the task continues with a clear operator notification in STATUS.md.
  Reviews are quality assurance, not a blocking gate.

### Benefits

- **Context preservation**: reviewer remembers earlier reviews and code patterns
- **Faster reviews**: no re-loading of codebase context for each review
- **Cost savings**: the reviewer's system prompt and codebase understanding are
  cached in context across reviews
- **Cross-step awareness**: reviewer can detect regressions and verify that
  earlier feedback was addressed

## Review artifacts

Typical on-disk artifacts:

- `.reviews/` directory in task folder
- `request-R00N.md` — generated review request
- `R00N-plan-stepN.md` / `R00N-code-stepN.md` — reviewer output with verdict
- Review rows appended to `STATUS.md` Reviews table

This keeps the audit trail local to the task.

---

## Design tradeoffs

Benefits:

- catches mistakes before merge
- enforces standards consistently
- worker addresses REVISE feedback with full context (no re-hydration)
- reviewer activity visible in dashboard

Costs:

- additional tokens/time per step
- reviewer model cost (mitigated by skipping low-risk steps)

Projects tune this via review levels and review-cycle limits.
