### Step 0: Preflight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Read each command handler (resume, integrate, pause, abort, status)
- [x] Read review_step tool registration as pattern reference
- [x] Understand pi registerTool() API
- [x] Identify execCtx dependencies per command

---

### Step 1: Register orchestrator tools
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Add `Type` import from `@mariozechner/pi-ai` to extension.ts
- [x] Extract `doOrchStatus` helper (shared by command + tool)
- [x] Extract `doOrchPause` helper (shared by command + tool)
- [x] Extract `doOrchResume` helper (shared by command + tool) — returns status message, calls startBatchAsync internally
- [x] Extract `doOrchAbort` helper (shared by command + tool) — works without execCtx
- [x] Extract `doOrchIntegrate` helper (shared by command + tool) — wraps parseIntegrateArgs + resolveIntegrationContext + executeIntegration
- [x] Refactor existing command handlers to call the extracted helpers
- [x] Register all 5 tools with Type.Object parameters, description, promptSnippet, promptGuidelines
- [x] Verify all tools return `{content: [{type: "text", text}], details: undefined}` and catch errors

---

### Step 2: Update supervisor prompt with tool awareness
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Add Available Orchestrator Tools section to supervisor monitoring prompt
- [x] Include tool names, parameters, and usage guidance
- [x] Add proactive usage examples

---

### Step 3: Testing & Verification

- [x] Tests for tool parameter schemas
- [x] Tests for supervisor prompt mentions tools

---

### Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Check affected docs
- [x] Discoveries logged
- [x] `.DONE` created
